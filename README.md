##  Data Preprocessing
- Missing values in Age filled using median
- Missing values in Embarked filled using mode
- No duplicate record filtering applied
- Pandas 3.0 compatible code (no inplace usage)

---

##  Visualizations Included
- Survival count plot
- Survival by gender
- Survival by passenger class
- Age distribution histogram
- Fare vs survival boxplot
- Correlation heatmap

---

##  Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates
- Higher-class passengers survived more
- Higher fare increased survival probability
- Younger passengers had better survival chances
- Overall survival rate was approximately 38%
